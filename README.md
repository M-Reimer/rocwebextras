Introduction
------------

To create a hardware device to control the train speed and attach this somehow to an Android device, I found that it is easiest to do this by emulating a keyboard and catching the keyboard keypresses on the RocWeb website.

BUT: I definitively don't want to contribute to RocRail directly given that it has very ugly licensing. I don't want to contribute to closed source proprietary code in my private spare time.

Another problem is that keyboard support was requested in the forums but rejected by the project developer.

That's why this Addon was created. It by default doesn't need any permissions. If you add your RocWeb URL in the Addon settings, it will request permission for just this one URL.

Contributing
------------

All the code in this repository is **licensed under GPL 3.0** (and so incompatible to the RocWeb licensing by intention). So if you want to contribute features to RocWeb Extras in an open source way, feel free to create Issues or Pull Requests.

Also feel free to write Issues or Pull Requests in german language!

---> Issues und Pull-Requests kÃ¶nnen gerne auch in deutscher Sprache erstellt werden! <---

Please no URLs to the Rocrail forum in Issues or Pull Requests. Copy all the relevant information directly to GitHub. I don't have a forum account and I won't create one.
